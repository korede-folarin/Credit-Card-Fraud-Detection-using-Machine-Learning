# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project implements a comprehensive machine learning solution for credit card fraud detection, combining both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Using a dataset of 284,807 credit card transactions, the system identifies fraudulent transactions while addressing the challenges of highly imbalanced data (fraud rate: 0.172%).
